{: .box-note}
The first stars in the universe produced energetic photons that ionized the neutral hydrogen gas pervading the universe at that time. This 'Epoch of Reionization (EoR)' is challenging to observe through telescopes, and we need fast and efficient ways to test our theoretical models through simulations. Traditional simulation methods prove to be expensive and slow, but using machine learning can help, and I show how in this talk. Not much background is needed and all the terminologies involved will be explained.

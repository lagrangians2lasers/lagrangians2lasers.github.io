Note: This talk will discuss both theoretical and experimental aspects of Dark Matter research.
\\
As many know, the ever elusive dark sectors of the universe - namely dark matter and dark energy - are estimated to make up nearly 95% of all energy present in the universe. But how do we know this? Is it simply a cosmic crop circle, or does it have some actual physical evidence? How is modern physics research tackling the dark sectors of the Universe? Are there any alternatives to the dark matter model? These are some of the major questions that will be addressed during the talk among a few other talking points. So, join this L2L talk for a journey to the dark side.

The discrepancy in the Hubble constant measurements, ranging from 4σ to 6σ, between local probes and the Cosmic Microwave Background observations, is still lively debated in the modern research. In this talk, we examine this tension using the SNe Ia data from the Pantheon sample, dividing it into 12 and 20 redshift (z) bins. For each bin, we perform a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation to determine the Hubble constant value and verify the Gaussianity of the residuals. Next,we estimate the Hubble constant values for each bin using a modified w0waCDM model. These H0 values are then fitted as a function of z. Our results indicate a decreasing trend, and it is interesting to discuss what implications to new physics and survey systematics this might have.

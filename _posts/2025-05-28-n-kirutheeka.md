{: .box-note}
Over the last decade, machine learning techniques have been widely adopted by various domains in particle physics. I will discuss using such ML algorithms and simulations in particle physics analysis and the challenges they present. Then, I will introduce a new approach I have been working on, explaining how I built an ML-based pipeline to generate faster simulations in reduced dimensions.

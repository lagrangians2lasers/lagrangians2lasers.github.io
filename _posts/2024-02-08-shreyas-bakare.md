{: .box-note}
Despite the success of the Standard Model in describing the interactions of elementary particles, observations that suggest the existence of additional phenomena remain. Many theories of physics beyond the Standard Model have been proposed that feature "final states" in high-energy proton-proton collisions with exactly four leptons.

In this talk, I will start with the basics of experimental high energy physics and move towards discussing this particular 4-lepton search that targets particular mixed flavor regions. The ideas will be motivated, so there is no need for much background!

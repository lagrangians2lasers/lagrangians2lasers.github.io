  <br>"Aristotle said a bunch of stuff that was wrong. Galileo and Newton fixed things up. Then Einstein broke everything again. Now, we've basically got it all worked out, except for small stuff, big stuff, hot stuff, cold stuff, fast stuff, heavy stuff, dark stuff, turbulence, and the concept of time."

Lagrangians to Lasers (L2L) is a journal club for Physics enthusiasts at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Pune.
The goal of this club is to act as a forum for people interested in different fields of physics. Students present their interests among their peers in a way that is comprehensible at the undergraduate level.

In our JC, we strive to bridge the communication gap among the various sub-fields of physics, fostering a more integrated understanding of the subject.
By participating in L2L, you'll stay connected with various developments across different areas of physics, helping you explore and refine your interests during your BS-MS degree.

This forum is not just about expanding your knowledge; it’s also an excellent opportunity to hone your presentation skills and build a network of like-minded individuals. Whether you’re passionate about quantum mechanics, astrophysics, particle physics, condensed matter, statistical physics or any other field, L2L offers a supportive community to share and grow.

We meet every Thursday at 6:30 PM in LHC 106.
